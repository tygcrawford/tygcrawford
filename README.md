# Hi there I'm Ty ðŸ‘‹

I enjoy making cool stuff to learn new concepts through code.

If you want to see my [personal site](https://tygcrawford.com) it is housed in the [angular-personal-site](https://github.com/tygcrawford/angular-personal-site) repository. Feel free to fork this project and modify it to fit your needs. If you're looking for some smaller and more visual projects then check out the stuff in my [code-canvas](https://github.com/tygcrawford/code_canvas) or [shaders](https://github.com/tygcrawford/shaders) repositories. And if you're looking for some larger more conceptual projects check out my [nnet](https://github.com/tygcrawford/nnet)  or [cryptocurrency](https://github.com/tygcrawford/cryptocurrency) repositories.
